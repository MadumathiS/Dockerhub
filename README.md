# Docker - DockerHub

## The mission

As a newly hired DevOps Engineer at a compagny called PetClinic. The company has a new website that has been written in Java. Given this [Github Repo](https://github.com/g0t4/jgsu-spring-petclinic), you have been asked to containerize the application within a docker image and publish the produced image to DockerHub registry in order to facilitate the deployment of future releases.

To help you achieve that goal, here are some of the steps you should go through:

- Make a new Github repository with the content of the original [Repo](https://github.com/g0t4/jgsu-spring-petclinic)
- Create a DockerHub account.
- Log in to DockerHub from your Terminal.
- Craft a Dockerfile.
- Run the tests and build the artifact.
- Build the Docker image.
- Tag your image.
- Push your image to Dockerhub.
- Pull your image from Dockerhub and run a container locally.
